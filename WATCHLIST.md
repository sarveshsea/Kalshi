## ⚠️ HOW TO USE THIS WATCHLIST

1. **Active Watch** = High conviction (70%+), ready to execute
   - These are plays I'd take if I could auto-execute
   - Review and place manually if you agree

2. **Monitoring** = Good setups, waiting for better entry
   - Price needs to move slightly
   - Or volume needs to confirm

3. **Check this file frequently** - Updates every time daemon scans (30s)
