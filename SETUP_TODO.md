# Kalshi Setup - TODO

## Current Status
⚠️ **READ-ONLY MODE** - No API credentials configured

## What's Needed
1. **Get Kalshi API credentials**
   - Sign up at kalshi.com
   - Generate API key in account settings
   - Set environment variables:
     ```bash
     export KALSHI_API_KEY_ID="your_key_id"
     export KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="/path/to/private_key.pem"
     ```

2. **Deposit funds** (when ready to trade)
   - Minimum: $10 to start
   - Recommended: $50-100 for position sizing

## What Works Now (Read-Only)
- ✅ Market scanning (limited public data)
- ✅ Opportunity detection framework
- ✅ Data collection infrastructure

## What Needs Credentials
- ❌ Full market details (spreads, volume, categories)
- ❌ Placing orders
- ❌ Position management
- ❌ Leaderboard tracking

## Priority
🔴 **LOW** - Focus on Underdog first (bet placed tonight)
- After Underdog proves profitable → Set up Kalshi
- Need credentials from user

---

**For now: Skip Kalshi, focus on RareCandy profitability.**
